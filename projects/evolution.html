				<div class="paragraph">
					Near the end of my first semester learning computer science, we were tasked with
					building a fully functional game within the 4 options they provide. Flappy Bird was offered as an option
					for the first time that year, but I chose it without hesitation because the TA told me we will
					independently implement a Neural Network that trains the bird to jump on its own. Though I had no idea
					what it was, I decided to give it a try.

							As you open the game, a welcome screen will ask you how you want to play this game: if you want

							like to see birds jumping freely without your intervention, choose “AI Player”, and the birds
							will start learning right away.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							If you choose the latter, a few learning parameters will be provided at the bottom because the
							birds can quickly be very smart — so smart that there might be no difference to an observer as
							it keeps on jumping! After a few generations of evolution, the birds can easily jump for more
							than a 1000 pipes in the game, an achievement that I have never even gotten close to. The
							vermilion-colored info bar also provides the users with buttons to fast-forward the learning
							process, and this functionality is especially useful when I need to observe the overall
							evolution trend (100 generations) but don’t have time to wait too long.

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Challenges</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Figuring out the object-oriented design, understanding Neural Network and solving the bug brought
					out by Array/ArrayList were probably the most difficult challenges I had to overcome in this
					project. We started this project by writing the traditional Flappy Bird game, which has one bird
					only and was fairly simple. However, as I moved on to implement the learning part of the project,
					the specification asked us to model a population with 50 birds, each is equipped with a Neural
					Network so that they can make independent decisions.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Initially, I decided to have a Population class controlling the life and death of those birds, a
					NeuralNetwork class that includes all the thinking processes, and a Bird class that models the shape
					and movement of birds. In my original implementation, my Bird class actually extends the
					NeuralNetwork class. My idea was that if I extend the NeuralNetwork class, I could use all its
					methods, which is equivalent to having an independent brain for every bird. Upon further thinking, I
					found out that though the idea itself works, it was bad object-oriented design since Bird is not a
					type of NeuralNetwork, and its containment diagram would not make any sense. I later on changed my
					method and instantiated a NeuralNetwork instance in my Bird object — this also reflects the
					real-world situation — now whenever I create a new Bird, it comes with a brain, the NeuralNetwork.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					After I decided on the structure of the project, now it’s time to understand what Neural Networks
					are. After some initial research, I realized that the simplest form of a Neural Network is just a
					layer of input nodes, a hidden layer where weight is being added, and a final output layer. The
					activation function then takes the value of the final out, and decides whether the birds should jump
					or not. Though all numbers are randomly generated at the beginning, the birds will gradually evolve
					if I select the weight of the best bird of the last round. By applying a very minimal amount of
					random variation to the “smart weight”, the birds can eventually reach a point where they only die
					by accident — like humans, birds also make “poor judgement” sometimes!
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					The hardest problem I encountered was to fix the bug induced by poor documentation. In my Population
					class, I included 17 Array and ArrayList of different dimensions — some are for weights, some are
					created to track the status of the bird, and the rest are used to record the statistics. Because
					there were so many different Arrays, I struggled to differentiate each Array’s function, and the
					specific data each dimension should hold. As a result, my application produces error messages at
					every single keyframe, and my birds all die immediately upon spawning. I spent more than 10 hours
					trying to debug using the println, however I yielded no result — the outputs are all random numbers
					ranging from 0 to 1, and there is no way for me to identify the validity of the data. That was the
					time I decided to rewrite the Population class; and this time, every time I created an Array, I
					commented in the code about the type of data each dimension of the Array should hold. After a
					complete overhaul, my birds finally started learning, and I was really proud.
				</div>
				<div class="blog-subtitle">Conclusion</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Evolution was definitely a highlight of my Object-oriented Programming (CS15) class. Afterall, I
					think my biggest takeaway from this was that thorough planning beforehand is important, and the
					proper documentation of variables and methods is critical. Since it is the final project, I was able to
					put everything I learned in the course — from EventHandler to Constructor Overloading — into use, and I
					would highly recommend this project for the future generations of CS15 students.
