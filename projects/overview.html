				as a dashboard for quiz bowl moderators. Multiple kinds of questions are read back-to-back during a quiz
				bowl tournament, and they are often contained in different documents or located on different pages of a
				giant PDF. Furthermore, the moderator has to keep score during this time, and teams earn different
				quantities of points depending on the question format and how quickly they answered.</div>

			<div class="project-description">A fully functional Flappy Bird game where users can either choose to play
				the game themselves, or let the bird learn to jump on their own. The neural network implemented on each
				bird powers their independent judgement, and by “natural selection”, the survival rate of the herd
				increase overtime. Submitted as final project for Introduction to Object-oriented Programming (CSCI
				0150).</div>
