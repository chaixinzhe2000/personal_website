					also post
					their reviews on a specific book that they have read. Various web APIs, including the ones from <a
						href="https://www.goodreads.com/api" class="link">GoodReads</a> and <a
						href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api" class="link">Open Library</a>, are used to provide

					In middle school, I had my first WordPress site called <i>DeltaTech</i>. As you might guess from the
					name, it was a technology news site, and it automatically collects new stories from popular mainstream
					news sources — just like what BuzzFeed or Pinterest does. Of course, it wasn’t me who implemented the
					web-scrapping functionality; instead, I hired someone online with all the pocket money I had, because
					the young me thought it would go big one day in the future. Sadly, it didn’t — no one other than my
					parents and my closest friends has ever visited it. As I was able to generate neither traffic nor
					revenue, I had to close the site after one year of running. Although it was a failed attempt, I knew
					that one day I want to learn to program, so I can rebuild my dream website <i>on my own</i>.

					Though I haven’t really accomplished my "ambitious plan" yet, taking <a
						href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/" class="link">CS50 Web Development</a> in my freshman
					summer was surely one step closer to "building a website on my own". So, here we are, my first
					functional web application, coded by <i>myself</i>.

							In the lecture, I learned about User Session, SQL inquiries and Flask routing, and I am sure to put these three
							things into use. Since Flask is a rather lightweight backend framework, I had to write the login and log out
							functionality on my own (surely there is Flask-Login plugin I can use, but this is for the practice). My design
							is as the following: when a user fills out the registration form and hits the submit button, the POST request
							will either verify the credentials with the database or create a new user if there isn’t a match. Then, the
							session variable “is_logged_in” will change from “false” to “true”, allowing the user to visit the searching
							page. The rather intuitive search page will allow users to input the information (ISBN, Book Name or Author) and
							use the “LIKE” SQL command to find potential matches for the book.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							For each book, I designed a detail page, so that the users can view more information about the book they like.
							The information comes from various APIs such as Open Library API and GoodReads API. It
							also includes a section where logged in users can share their book review with the community. Upon form
							submission, the page will refresh and load the updated comments list from the database. If a user submits another
							comment, it will override the first one stored in the database.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							Lastly, I also included an API that outputs the book information in JSON file, so other sites (hopefully),
							could utilize it to obtain book metadata all at the same time. The web application is currently hosted on Heroku,
							and since it’s on free plan, the server might need a few seconds to wake up from hibernation.

					Figuring out the object-oriented design, understanding Neural Network and solving the bug brought
					out by Array/ArrayList were probably the most difficult challenges I had to overcome in this
					project. We started this project by writing the traditional Flappy Bird game, which has one bird
					only and was fairly simple. However, as we moved on to implement the learning part of the project,
					the specification asked us to model a population with 50 birds, each is equipped with a Neural
					Network so that they can make independent decisions.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Initially, I decided to have a Population class controlling the life and death of those birds, a
					NeuralNetwork class that includes all the thinking processes, and a Bird class that models the shape
					and movement of birds. In my original implementation, my Bird class actually extends the
					NeuralNetwork class. My idea was that if I extend the NeuralNetwork class, I could use all its
					methods, which is equivalent to having an independent brain for every bird. Upon further thinking, I
					found out that though the idea itself works, it was bad object-oriented design since Bird is not a
					type of NeuralNetwork, and its containment diagram would not make any sense. I later on changed my
					method and instantiated a NeuralNetwork instance in my Bird object — this also reflects the
					real-world situation — now whenever I create a new Bird, it comes with a brain, the NeuralNetwork.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					After I decided on the structure of the project, now it’s time to understand what Neural Networks
					are. After some initial research, I realized that the simplest form of a Neural Network is just a
					layer of input nodes, a hidden layer where weight is being added, and a final output layer. The
					activation function then takes the value of the final out, and decides whether the birds should jump
					or not. Though all numbers are randomly generated at the beginning, the birds will gradually evolve
					if I select the weight of the best bird of the last round. By applying a very minimal amount of
					random variation to the “smart weight”, the birds can eventually reach a point where they only die
					by accident — like humans, birds also make “poor judgement” sometimes!
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					The hardest problem I encountered was to fix the bug induced by poor documentation. In my Population
					class, I included 17 Array and ArrayList of different dimensions — some are for weights, some are
					created to track the status of the bird, and the rest are used to record the statistics. Because
					there were so many different Arrays, I struggled to differentiate each Array’s function, and the
					specific data each dimension should hold. As a result, my application produces error messages at
					every single keyframe, and my birds all die immediately upon spawning. I spent more than 10 hours
					trying to debug using the println, however I yielded no result — the outputs are all random numbers
					ranging from 0 to 1, and there is no way for me to identify the validity of the data. That was the
					time I decided to rewrite the Population class; and this time, every time I created an Array, I
					commented in the code about the type of data each dimension of the Array should hold. After a
					complete overhaul, my birds finally started learning, and I was really proud.
				</div>
				<div class="blog-subtitle">Conclusion</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Evolution was definitely a highlight of my Object-oriented Programming (CS15) class. Afterall, I
					think my biggest takeaway from this was that thorough planning beforehand is important, and the
					proper documentation of variables and methods is critical. As the final project, I was able to put
					everything I learned in the course — from EventHandler to Constructor Overloading — into use, and I
					would highly recommend this project for the future generations of CS15 students.
