			<div class="paragraph">
				In middle school, I had my first WordPress site called <i>DeltaTech</i>. As you might guess from the
				name, it was a technology news site, and it automatically collects new stories from popular mainstream
				news sources — just like what BuzzFeed or Pinterest does. Of course, it wasn’t me who implemented the
				web-scrapping functionality; instead, I hired someone online with all the pocket money I had, because
				the young me thought it would go big one day in the future. Sadly, it didn’t — no one other than my
				parents and my closest friends has ever visited it. As I was able to generate neither traffic nor
				revenue, I had to close the site after one year of running. Although it was a failed attempt, I knew
				that one day I want to learn to program, so I can rebuild my dream website <i>on my own</i>.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				Though I haven’t really accomplished my "ambitious plan" yet, taking <a
					href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/" class="link">CS50 Web Development</a> in my freshman
				summer was surely one step closer to "building a website on my own". So, here we are, my first
				functional web application, coded by <i>myself</i>.

						As you open the game, a welcome screen will ask you how you want to play this game: if you want
						to try it yourself and enjoy some Flappy Bird time, click “Humanity First”! However, if you’d
						like to see birds jumping freely without your intervention, choose “AI Player”, and the birds
						will start learning right away.
					</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						If you choose the latter, a few learning parameters will be provided at the bottom because the
						birds can quickly be very smart — so smart that there might be no difference to an observer as
						it keeps on jumping! After a few generations of evolution, the birds can easily jump for more
						than a 1000 pipes in the game, an achievement that I have never even gotten close to. The
						vermilion-colored info bar also provides the users with buttons to fast-forward the learning
						process, and this functionality is especially useful when I need to observe the overall
						evolution trend (100 generations) but don’t have time to wait too long.

			<div class="blog-subtitle">Challenges</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				Figuring out the object-oriented design, understanding Neural Network and solving the bug brought
				out by Array/ArrayList were probably the most difficult challenges I had to overcome in this
				project. We started this project by writing the traditional Flappy Bird game, which has one bird
				only and was fairly simple. However, as we moved on to implement the learning part of the project,
				the specification asked us to model a population with 50 birds, each is equipped with a Neural
				Network so that they can make independent decisions.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				Initially, I decided to have a Population class controlling the life and death of those birds, a
				NeuralNetwork class that includes all the thinking processes, and a Bird class that models the shape
				and movement of birds. In my original implementation, my Bird class actually extends the
				NeuralNetwork class. My idea was that if I extend the NeuralNetwork class, I could use all its
				methods, which is equivalent to having an independent brain for every bird. Upon further thinking, I
				found out that though the idea itself works, it was bad object-oriented design since Bird is not a
				type of NeuralNetwork, and its containment diagram would not make any sense. I later on changed my
				method and instantiated a NeuralNetwork instance in my Bird object — this also reflects the
				real-world situation — now whenever I create a new Bird, it comes with a brain, the NeuralNetwork.
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				After I decided on the structure of the project, now it’s time to understand what Neural Networks
				are. After some initial research, I realized that the simplest form of a Neural Network is just a
				layer of input nodes, a hidden layer where weight is being added, and a final output layer. The
				activation function then takes the value of the final out, and decides whether the birds should jump
				or not. Though all numbers are randomly generated at the beginning, the birds will gradually evolve
				if I select the weight of the best bird of the last round. By applying a very minimal amount of
				random variation to the “smart weight”, the birds can eventually reach a point where they only die
				by accident — like humans, birds also make “poor judgement” sometimes!
			</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				The hardest problem I encountered was to fix the bug induced by poor documentation. In my Population
				class, I included 17 Array and ArrayList of different dimensions — some are for weights, some are
				created to track the status of the bird, and the rest are used to record the statistics. Because
				there were so many different Arrays, I struggled to differentiate each Array’s function, and the
				specific data each dimension should hold. As a result, my application produces error messages at
				every single keyframe, and my birds all die immediately upon spawning. I spent more than 10 hours
				trying to debug using the println, however I yielded no result — the outputs are all random numbers
				ranging from 0 to 1, and there is no way for me to identify the validity of the data. That was the
				time I decided to rewrite the Population class; and this time, every time I created an Array, I
				commented in the code about the type of data each dimension of the Array should hold. After a
				complete overhaul, my birds finally started learning, and I was really proud.
			</div>
			<div class="blog-subtitle">Conclusion</div>
			<div class="paragraph">
				Evolution was definitely a highlight of my Object-oriented Programming (CS15) class. Afterall, I
				think my biggest takeaway from this was that thorough planning beforehand is important, and the
				proper documentation of variables and methods is critical. As the final project, I was able to put
				everything I learned in the course — from EventHandler to Constructor Overloading — into use, and I
				would highly recommend this project for the future generations of CS15 students.
