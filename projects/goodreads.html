					GoodReads Premium is a web application that allows users to register, login, and query a sample catalog
					of more than 5,000 popular books that are stored in a PostgreSQL database. Once logged in, users can
					also post
					their reviews on a specific book that they have read. Various web APIs, including the ones from <a
						href="https://www.goodreads.com/api" class="link">GoodReads</a> and <a
						href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/api" class="link">Open Library</a>, are used to provide
					more relevant data for the book. All data stored in the database was obtained from the CS50 Web
					Development <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/" class="link"> course
						website</a>.

				<div class="paragraph">
					In middle school, I had my first WordPress site called <i>DeltaTech</i>. As you might guess from the
					name, it was a technology news site, and it automatically collects new stories from popular mainstream
					news sources — just like what BuzzFeed or Pinterest does. Of course, it wasn’t me who implemented the
					web-scrapping functionality; instead, I hired someone online with all the pocket money I had, because
					the young me thought it would go big one day in the future. Sadly, it didn’t — no one other than my
					parents and my closest friends has ever visited it. As I was able to generate neither traffic nor
					revenue, I had to close the site after one year of running. Although it was a failed attempt, I knew
					that one day I want to learn to program, so I can rebuild my dream website on my own.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Though I haven’t really accomplished my "ambitious plan" yet, taking <a
						href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/" class="link">CS50 Web Development</a> in my freshman
					summer was surely one step closer to "building a website on my own". So, here we are, my first
					functional web application.
				</div>

				<div class="text-picture">
					<div class="paragraph-group">
						<div class="paragraph">
							In the lecture, I learned about User Session, SQL inquiries and Flask routing, and I am sure to put these three
							things into use. Since Flask is a rather lightweight backend framework, I had to write the login and log out
							functionality on my own (there is Flask-Login plugin I can use, but this is for the practice). My design
							is as the following: when a user fills out the registration form and hits the submit button, the POST request
							will either verify the credentials with the database or create a new user if there isn’t a match. Then, the
							session variable “is_logged_in” will change from “false” to “true”, allowing the user to visit the search
							page. The search page will allow users to input the information (ISBN, Book Name or Author) and
							use the “LIKE” SQL command to find potential matches for the book.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							For each book, I designed a detail page, so that the users can view more information about the book they like.
							The information comes from various APIs such as Open Library API and GoodReads API. It
							also includes a section where logged in users can share their book review with the community. Upon form
							submission, the page will refresh and load the updated comments list from the database. If a user submits another
							comment, it will override the first one stored in the database.
						</div>
						<div class="paragraph">
							Lastly, I also included an API that outputs the book information in JSON file, so other sites (hopefully),
							could utilize it to obtain book metadata all at the same time. The web application is currently hosted on Heroku,
							and since it’s on free plan, the server might need a few seconds to wake up from hibernation.
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="blog-subtitle">Page Design</div>
					<div class="paragraph">
						To make the site feel welcoming and "book-like", I chose a ivory color as the background, and used matte green to
						contrast with it. Most of the informations are in black, as I want to make sure they are clearly eligible. The
						fonts I used are Josefin Sans and Crimson Pro, to represent headings and paragraphs respectively.

				<div class="blog-subtitle">Conclusion</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Though the project is likely still in its beta stages—the registration process is far from secure, and there might
					be some layout issues on mobile browsers—I am still very proud of what I did, as it reaffirmed my belief that one
					day I can build useful and aesthetically pleasing tools to make everyone’s life easier.

				<div class="paragraph">
					It allowed me to have a glimpse of full stack web development, and really opened the door for me to many exciting
					opportunities. Later on, I used what I learned to build the portfolio that you are reading right now, got an
					internship in web development, and joined <a href="https://www.fullstackatbrown.com/about" class="link">Full Stack
						at Brown</a> to help students and organizations build their web presence.
				</div>
				<div class="paragraph">
					Taking <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/" class="link">CS50w</a> during the pandemic was probably the best decision I’ve made in 2020.
